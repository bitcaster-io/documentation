Overview
========

Bitcaster is a system-to-user signal-to-message notification system.

Bitcaster will receive signals from any of your applications/systems using a
simple RESTful API and will convert them in messages to be distributed to your users
via a plethora of channels.

Messages content is customised at user/receiver level using a flexible template system.

Your user will be empowered with an easy to use console to choose how to receive the
messages configured in Bitcaster.

Bitcaster comes loaded with all of the following channel plugins:


* Facebook
* Gmail
* Hangout
* skype
* slack
* twitter
* SMS (Plivo, Twilio)

Many others plugins are under development or you can :ref:`create_plugin` if needed.
